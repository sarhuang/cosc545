"Note: Based on prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year released from state prison by expirations of sentence, commutations, and other unconditional releases. Detail may not sum to total due to rounding, missing offense data, and race categories not shown. Release totals from National Prisoner Statistics Program. Offense distribution based on National Corrections Reporting Program administrative data. Estimates may vary from those previously published due to differences in methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget published guidelines on the collection and reporting of Hispanic origin in 1997 (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards/) and few states collected Hispanic origin data in 1991. Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are included in the white and black categories. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b/Race and Hispanic origin data are weighted to represent the race/ethnicity distribution from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
